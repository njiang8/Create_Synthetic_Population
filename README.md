Our methods use open-source data as the input to generate synthetic population as the table shown below. If the following links are no longer valid, the data can be found in https://osf.io/3vsaj/ under the input folder. The results files can be found under the output folder.

Our method includes the following steps:
* [Step 1](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population/blob/master/0_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb). Data preprocessing, clean raod network and commute infomation
* [Step 2](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population/blob/master/1_Creat_Individuals.ipynb).	Generating workplaces, individual agents organized into households and place workplaces and  individuals on the cleaned road lines. 
* [Step 3a](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population/blob/master/2_Assign_Kids_School_Daycare_Unique_IDs.ipynb).	Assigning individual agents to their daytime locations including work, school and daycare
* [Step 3b](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population/blob/master/3_Assign%20RID.ipynb).  Assigning unique Road ID (extracted from road line) to individual agents, work loactions, school and daycare.
* [Step 4](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population/blob/master/4_Create_Networks.ipynb).	Creating individual networks representing group membership in a family or other household type and either a work or school
